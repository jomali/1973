	-	"Grasping Whispers", by Jimmy Gelhaar <www.jimmygelhaar.com>

Instruments:  Piano Solo

Time:  4/4

Description:  When in times of desperation and sadness, there is nothing better for this old soul than the sounds of a piano and a few of my favorite chords. 

Slow and disjointed but musically, the piece makes a nice solid unit.
