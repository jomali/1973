<h2 class="articlehead">A Comparison of TADS 3 and Inform 7</h2>

<h4 class="byline">by <a href="mailto:eric.eve@hmc.ox.ac.uk">Eric Eve</a></h4>

<div class="articletext">

<p>Today's interactive fiction writer has a fair variety of authoring
systems to choose from, but the two which seem currently to be the
most state-of-the-art are TADS 3 and Inform 7. Although both are
powerful and sophisticated tools, their design philosophies are rather
different, as are their target consituencies. As I understand it,
Inform 7 was (at least partly) designed to attract the non-programmer,
whereas TADS 3 was aimed more at the power user. But it would be a
grave mistake to assume from this that Inform 7 is <i>only</i>
suitable for the beginner; it too has a lot to offer the power
user. So while TADS 3 may seem impossibly inaccessible to many of the
people attracted to Inform 7, many more experienced authors may face a
genuine choice between the two.</p>

<p>From time to time discussions occur on <a
href="/community/discussion/usenet.html">the Usenet newsgroup
rec.arts.int-fiction</a> or elsewhere extolling the comparative
virtues of these two systems. These discussions tend to focus on a few
of the more obvious differences between them, such as natural language
vs.  C-style coding, rule-based vs object-oriented programming, and
the greater complexity of the TADS 3 world model. While these obvious
differences <i>are</i> important, they are not the only ones, and may
not necessarily be the most significant ones when it comes to choosing
which system to use for a particular project. The present article is
not an attempt to argue than one system is better than the other (in
my opinion they are both very good at what they do), but rather to
give a more rounded comparison of the two systems, dealing not only
with some of the commonly observed differences but also with some of
the subtler ones that are often missed.</p>

<p>A wide selection of extensions is available for both systems, and
game authors can generally add many other features in their own code,
should they need them. The principle comparison I shall be making,
therefore, is not what between what is possible in each system, but
what each system offers "out of the box" in terms of the default
features built into its language and standard library. In this
context, "out of the box" and "built in" will often be used in a
minimalistic sense: more or less the adv3 library in the case of TADS
3 and the Standard Rules in the case of Inform 7 (the rationale for
this will be explained below). The comparison will be between the
latest versions of the two systems at the time of writing (Inform 5U92
and TADS 3.0.17).</p>

<h3 class="subhead">Some Fundamental Similarities</h3>

<p>Before embarking on a discussion of the differences between Inform
7 and TADS 3, it may first be worth calling to attention to
certain ways in which they are fundamentally alike:</p>

<ol>
<li>At root, they both work with the same idea of what an IF
world-model should look like. At the highest level are one or more
rooms which may be interconnected, typically along a compass
direction. Each room typically represents a distinct region of space
within which everything it contains is (with certain common
exceptions) immediately available to the player. Everything else in
play must be either directly or indirectly within a room or
rooms. Certain other kinds of objects can also contain other objects,
and some can also contain actors, but a given object can only support
one kind of containment. That is, you can't have an object you can
both put things inside and on top of, though you can of course fake
this by using multiple objects that look like a single object to the
player. Certain objects can be picked up and carried around by the
player character and other actors, while others are fixed in
place.</li>

<li>Both systems assume that the game will be advanced by the player
entering commands at the command prompt. Both therefore provide
analogous (if different in detail) mechanisms for parsing the commands
and resolving them to the appropriate actions and objects. Both
systems assume that, in addition to laying out the game map and the
objects occupying it, one of the game author's main tasks will be to
code non-default responses to attempts to manipulate in-game objects
or converse with NPCs. To assist the game author, both systems provide
a substantial range of standard built-in actions with sensible default
responses, actions which are often more-or-less similar in both
systems. Although the list of standard actions differs between the two
systems, there is a considerable degree of overlap.</li>

<li>Both systems cater well for the common need to output variable
text. Although the details of the syntax vary considerably, in essence
the various "[ ]" constructs in Inform 7 and the "&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;"
construct in TADS 3 allow alternative output within displayed text, or
allow the display of text to trigger some other side effect. Both
systems provide mark-up to allow authors to display bold and italic
text. Both have mechanisms whereby lists of items may be displayed in
various different types of random order.</li>

<li>Both systems implement common mechanisms for triggering actions on
specified turns such as fuses and daemons (even if they go under
different names in Inform 7) useful to a turn-based environment.</li>

<li>Both systems provide programming languages particularly tailored
to the writing of interactive fiction. Both languages, however
different they appear on the surface, provide most of the common
looping and conditional constructs, user-defined functions, a range of
data types and the like, all of which combine to provide authors with
the kind of power and flexibility they need to make interesting things
happen in their games.</li>

<li>The addition of lists, indexed texts and regular expressions to
Inform 7 has also provided it with many features long present in TADS
3 that earlier versions of Inform 7 lacked.</li>
</ol>

<p>These similarities are far from accidental, of course. Not only are
both systems trying to achieve many of the same goals (providing
authors with the tools to write parser-based interactive fiction
according to a fairly-well recognized set of established conventions),
they have both been created by people who have long experience with
creating successful IF authoring systems and an excellent
understanding of the problems involved. Moreover, both systems have
benefited considerably from a great deal of user
feedback. Nonetheless, the similarities are far from trivial; it is by
no means inevitable that all IF authoring systems should share all
these features, while the fact that TADS 3 and Inform 7 do means that
many games can be equally well implemented in either system.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">Some Obvious Differences</h3>

<p>Many of the more obvious differences between TADS 3 and Inform 7
have been rehearsed many times before, so here I shall deal with them
only quite briefly. I shall also try to call attention to some of the
less-discussed consequences of these differences.</p>

<h4 class="subhead">Not Just a Language: Workbench vs I7 IDE</h4>

<p>Inform 7 is more than a language, library and compiler; it is a
complete system for the authoring of Interactive Fiction. The same
could be said of TADS 3 on Windows, for which the TADS 3 Workbench is
available. The I7 IDE and the TADS 3 Workbench are very different in
look and feel, but broadly comparable in overall functionality; they
do not provide precisely the same set of features, of course, but
there is a considerable amount of overlap. For example, both have a
built-in editor, both allow the documentation to be viewed from within
the IDE, both support one-click compilation and play-testing of game
code from within the IDE, both automatically record the play-testing
commands and allow the previous session to be replayed at the click of
the button, and both provide facilities for publishing the final
game. That said, there are many things they do very differently, in
part because they are designed to work with very different kinds of
language.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most significant difference is that, while the Inform 7
IDE is available on all major platforms, TADS 3 Workbench (though not
TADS 3 itself) is effectively limited to Windows; a detailed
comparison of Workbench with the I7 IDE would therefore not be all
that relevant to non-Windows users.  So in place of a detailed
feature-by-feature comparison I shall just offer a few brief initial
remarks (supplemented by a few further incidental remarks in the
course of this article).</p>

<p>Clearly a huge amount of thought has gone into the design of the
Inform 7 IDE to provide an uncluttered-looking user-friendly interface
that nevertheless offers a wide range of features (such as indexes,
integrated documentation, the transcript, the skein, and the world
map) to aid the authoring of Interactive Fiction. Workbench also
provides a huge amount of functionality, presented to the user through
a neat but seemingly more complex interface using a considerably
larger number of menu options, dialogue boxes and task bar buttons. At
a first approximation, Inform 7 presents itself as an author-friendly
tool while TADS 3 Workbench presents itself as a programmer-friendly
tool.</p>

<p>One way in which the Inform 7 presents itself is more
author-friendly is that instructions for its use are built into the
"Writing with Inform" manual and explained in the opening chapter,
while the instructions for using Workbench come in a help file of
their own (readily accessible from the help menu or the appropriate
taskbar button) and may seem a bit more technically daunting to the
new user; Workbench makes less effort to appear novice-friendly and to
present itself as an essential component of the system (which it is
not, although it is an exceedingly valuable one).  On the other hand
the Workbench interface is much more customizable; the user is given
far greater control over such matters as window layout and syntax
colouring than the Inform 7 IDE caters for (as well as a host of other
options besides). If you don't like the way Workbench looks out of the
box the chances are you'll be able to change it to something you do
like.</p>

<p>At least on my Windows machine, Workbench can often seem quite a
bit faster than the Inform 7 IDE. On occasion, both the Inform 7
editor and the built-in interpreter can seem relatively sluggish
compared with their Workbench equivalents (or, indeed, compared with
standalone Windows interpreters for Inform games such as Frotz or
Glulxe). Every now and again I've experienced the Inform editor almost
grind to a halt when I've been trying to edit something (for reasons
I've yet to work out in detail, but which seem to be related to having
a large amount of text in the source file being edited), and of course
commenting or uncommenting a large block of text in a large file can
be a bit slow. I've seldom encountered this kind of problem with the
Workbench editor.  When running a game from Workbench, responses to
player commands generally seem almost instantaneous, while in the
Inform IDE it feels like there's a very slight lag. This scarcely
matters when entering individual commands but can add up to a
substantial speed difference when replaying a previous session through
a stored script (Workbench) or the Skein (Inform). TADS 3 also allows
separate compilation of each source file, so that if a game is
recompiled, only the effected source file need be recompiled, leading
to a much shorter recompile time (see further below). Taken together,
these two factors make Workbench feel like a significantly faster
application when it comes to recompiling a game and replaying the
previous session to test the effect of a small change in the source
code.</p>

<p>Speed apart, both the Inform 7 IDE and TADS Workbench have a great
deal to recommend them, and both do a good job with providing game
authors with the toolset they need to work with their respective
systems. For the Windows user, there is little reason to prefer one
system to the other on the basis of the IDEs, other than as a matter
of personal preference and taste. For the non-Windows user the
situation is different: if the convenience of a fully-featured IDE is
important to you, then Inform 7 will score heavily over TADS 3 in this
regard. If, on the other hand, you are the sort of person who prefers
to use their favourite programming editor and is quite happy using
command-line tools, then you may be quite happy with TADS 3.</p>

<h4 class="subhead">Source Files and Compilation</h4>

<p>Inform 7 expects an entire game to be written in one large source
file (apart from any extensions employed), whereas TADS 3 (with or
without Workbench) allows a game to be split over as many files as the
author likes (and also supplies its standard library as a collection
of different source files). It has been suggested that the TADS 3
approach makes it easier for game authors to organize and navigate
their source code, since it can be conveniently divided into
reasonably short chunks. Personal preferences apart, however, it's not
obvious to me that there's much functional difference between TADS 3
and Inform 7 in this respect, since the Inform IDE provides so many
tools to assist authors in navigating their source files. In Workbench
(or whatever other editor you use to edit your source code) you'd
click on a tab to switch source files. In Inform 7 you'd click on
"Contents" and then click on a section title to jump to a particular
section of code. From the point of view of navigation, dividing source
into separate files in TADS 3 is not much different from dividing it
into sections in Inform 7. From the point of view of editing code the
one potential disadvantage of the Inform 7 approach is the occasional
slow-down that seems to occur when trying to edit a very large source
file (unless this is just an idiosyncrasy of my machine).</p>

<p>What is far more significant about the ability to split game code
over multiple source files in TADS 3 is that TADS 3 supports
<i>separate compilation</i>. This means that TADS 3 compiles each
source file separately (both author code and the files that make up
the library), writing the compiled version out to a series of object
files, and then links the object files to form the final game image
file. Then, when a game is recompiled, only those source files that
have changed since the last compilation need be compiled again. The
object files then need to be relinked, of course, but this takes very
little time. Thus, once a TADS 3 game has been compiled for the first
time, subsequent recompiles are generally very fast, often much faster
than recompiling an Inform 7 game of comparable size. Recompiling an
Inform 7 game requires recompiling everything &ndash; game code,
extension code, Standard Rules and all &ndash; over again from
scratch, whereas recompiling a TADS 3 game may only require the
recompilation of a single (and perhaps quite small) source file. An
Inform 7 recompile is thus inevitably much slower since the Inform 7
compiler has so much more work to do.</p>

<p>There's no suggestion here that the TADS 3 compiler is otherwise
inherently more efficient than the Inform 7 compiler. Indeed,
compiling a minimal game from scratch seems to me to take just
slightly longer in TADS 3 than in Inform 7 (probably because TADS 3
has a larger default library), but compiling a game for the first time
from scratch is something one generally only needs to do once. If your
development method involves frequent cycles of making a few changes to
source code, recompiling and then testing the result, TADS 3's
separate compilation can become a significant time-saver.</p>

<h4 class="subsubhead">Natural Language vs C-Style Coding</h4>

<p>It is well known that Inform 7 code resembles natural language (or
at least, a subset of English), while TADS code resembles a more
traditional programming language like C++ (on which it is in any case
based). Which of these is intrinsically better for writing interactive
fiction is scarcely worth discussing, since in the end this is likely
to come down to subjective preference, which in turn is likely to be
greatly influenced by previous experience. While certain natural
language constructs may appear more verbose than their TADS 3
equivalents (e.g. <code>increase index by 1</code> as against
<code>index++</code>) it is far from obvious to me that one language
works out as more verbose than the other overall. That any given
individual may find one language easier to read than the other is
unsurprising. People not used to coding in a traditional programming
language are likely to find Inform 7 code easier to read. People more
used to coding in C-like languages may well find they can mentally
parse TADS 3 code more readily; this may in part be due to the way in
which code is typically laid out in the two languages, with well laid
out TADS 3 code typically employing more white space, together with
indentation and braces that make the structure of the code more
immediately apparent.</p>

<p>That said, to regard Inform's English-like syntax as a form of
syntactic sugar designed to reassure the non-programmer is to miss the
point, which is that this style of syntax can often provide a clear
and economical way of expressing powerful constructs. Inform 7's
approach really comes into its own with the power and elegance of
statements like:</p>

<div class="i7code">
now every dangerous door is closed.
</div>

<p>To be sure, the savvy TADS 3 programmer can also achieve the same
result in one line of code, but what a line of code it is:</p>

<div class="i7code">
forEachInstance(Door, new function(x) { if(x.isDangerous) x.makeOpen(nil); } );
</div>

<p>Not only is the meaning of the TADS 3 version less immediately
apparent than the Inform 7 version, but the TADS 3 version is
noticeably less compact (and thus provides a useful counter-example to
the suggestion that Inform 7 code is more verbose in general).</p>

<p>The Inform 7 approach also offers great economy in object
definition. For example, to make a red ball object, one can simply
define:</p>
<div class="i7code">
The red ball is in the garden.
</div>
<p>This creates an object which can be referred to as the red ball in source code, will be called 'red ball' in inventory and room listings, and can be referred to as 'red ball' by the player on the command line. To achieve the same effect in TADS 3 it would be necessary to write:</p>
<div class="i7code">
redBall:Thing 'red ball' 'red ball' @garden;
</div>

<p>Yet although the TADS 3 does require repetition of the words "red
ball", it does allow the TADS 3 author more control, particularly in
the case where she wants the internal name, display name and
vocabulary words to differ. To be sure, they can be made to differ in
Inform 7 easily enough too, but this then requires additional work
which negates the advantage over TADS 3. More importantly, the Inform
7 approach is prone to silent name clash errors, while such errors are
readily apparent in TADS 3. For example, if in an Inform 7 game I
create an object called 'red ball' and later create another object
called 'big red ball', the Inform 7 compiler can become confused about
which object 'red ball' in my code is meant to refer to, sometimes
resulting in quite baffling bugs. This can hardly occur in TADS 3
since the compiler will catch any name clash error and refuse to
compile the game until the author fixes it.</p>

<p>Some people feel that a disadvantage of Inform 7's English-like
syntax is that it is more difficult to remember what the correct
syntax is, since statements that look equally correct in English may
not in fact be equally valid I7 syntax. There is <i>some</i> force in
this point &mdash; at least, I've often found myself caught
out in this way &mdash but in part it comes down to gaining
familiarity with the language. I've also been caught out with silly
syntax errors such as hard-to-track-down mismatched brackets in TADS
3. Part of the problem may be that Inform 7's language is in some
respects more complex than TADS 3's. The distinction between language
and library is less distinct (from the author's point of view) in
Inform 7 than TADS 3, so to some extent the Inform 7 language ends up
being more expressive and encompasses a wider range of concepts (the
same jobs in TADS 3 being accomplished by method or function
calls). Again, to someone used to using a C-like language, TADS 3 is
likely to appear more systematically consistent. But all this adds up
to is a series of explanations why certain individuals may find one
language easier to work with than the other; it does not make one
language objectively better than the other, and, for the most part, I
haven't found either language intrinsically easier to use than the
other. In my experience, the difficult problems in writing interactive
fiction tend to have more to do with design than with implementation,
and the trickier implementation problems have more to do with getting
the logic right than getting the syntax right. I also find myself
equally capable of committing syntactical blunders in any
language.</p>

<p>The TADS 3 language does have one clear advantage, however, and
that is that the library is written in the same language that game
authors code their game in. That in principle makes the entire TADS 3
library accessible and modifiable without the author needing to be
familiar with another language. The Inform 7 library, in contrast, is
written in Inform 6. The TADS 3 language also contains keywords such
as <code>inherited</code>, <code>replace</code> and
<code>modify</code> which in theory make it straightforward to replace
or modify any part of the standard library's code in one's own. In
practice, of course, it may not be quite that easy, since parts of
TADS 3's standard library are so complex that only the most stout of
heart will make the attempt. The capability is nonetheless there, and
not all parts of the library are particularly hard to figure out if
one wants to customise their behaviour.</p>

<p>This commonality of language confers a further advantage. In TADS 3
one can step through both game and library code one statement at a
time in the Workbench debugger, provided one has a computer than runs
Workbench. While Inform 7 has a range of high-level debugging tools
which TADS 3 to some extent lacks (like RULES ON or SHOWME), these
never quite allow you to trace the execution of your program through
your Inform 7 code. Although in practice I've generally managed to
track down bugs without too much difficulty (once I know they're
there) in my Inform 7 work, the ability to step through the source
code as I can in TADS 3 Workbench is certainly something I've
missed. The low-level debugging marvel provided by Workbench does have
a downside, in that it can become a bit confusing tracing execution
through some of the more complex parts of the library. It nevertheless
remains an invaluable debugging aid that Inform 7 struggles to match,
and I'm not sure that a debugger that stepped through Inform 7 code
would be even possible (though neither do I know that it wouldn't
be).</p>

<h4 class="subsubhead">Object-Orientation vs. Rules</h4>

<p>It is also well known that TADS 3 takes a strictly object-oriented
approach while Inform 7 takes a rules-based approach to programming
IF. To my mind, this is important in determining what kind of coding
style works best for each system but utterly irrelevant in determining
which system is better. Despite theoretical objections I've seen to
each approach, in practice I've found both to be equally serviceable
in getting done the things I've wanted to get done. If you need to
make an arbitrary choice of what object to define a method on in TADS
3, ninety-nine times out of a hundred you just get on and do it and
there's no practical difficulty. If you need to define your own rule
ordering in Inform 7, you just get on and do it using the statements
provided for the purpose, and again there's no real problem in
practice. The main difficulty, I think, is the mental change of gear
needed to get the best out of one approach when one is used to working
with the other.</p>

<p>This is not to say that neither has the advantage over the other in
certain particular cases. Multiple inheritance and the encapsulation
of code and data clearly enable programming strategies that can be
pursued readily in TADS 3 but only with difficulty in Inform 7 &mdash;
this is one barrier I've found to providing an Inform 7 version of the
TADS conversation system I'm really happy with. At the least, they
might prove a bit cumbersome in Inform 7 since it has not been
designed with that kind of programming structure in mind. Conversely
Inform 7 rules can allow a flexibility not always easy to achieve in
practice in TADS 3, for example by slotting a custom rule into the
turn sequence rules. While the same effect could no doubt be obtained
in TADS 3 by modifying the appropriate function or method, the problem
is to track down which one that is, and then &mdash; in the worst case
&mdash; finding one has to copy and paste the whole of a large and
complex method just to insert one's custom step.</p>

<p>In certain cases TADS 3's object-orientation can feel as if it is
imposing a more structured approach, particularly in the way one
writes action processing code. In Inform 7 I find it's possible to end
up writing a bunch of before, instead, check, carry out, after and
report rules which do the job but which can feel perilously <i>ad
hoc</i> (because I've ended up choosing which rulebooks to use just to
make things happen in the right order rather than following a
well-ordered system), whereas TADS 3 almost forces one to use the
various action processing object methods (preCond, remap, verify,
check, and action) in a consistently systematic manner, since each has
a clearly defined function. To be sure, the Inform 7 action processing
rulebooks do have functions that are reasonably well defined in
"Writing in Inform", but in practice I find it's easier to end up
blurring them than would be the case in TADS 3. It's also easier to
override an action-processing method on a TADS 3 subclass than it is
to bypass an action-processing rule in Inform 7. In TADS 3 you can
simply override the check method (say) on the subclass or individual
object. If you've written a 'check frobbing something' rule in Inform
7, however, the only ways you can stop it applying to a sub-kind of
Thing or a particular Thing object are either with a procedural rule
(too many of which can impact on run-time efficiency) or by writing
special case exceptions into the check frobbing rule (possible but
potentially a bit messy).</p>

<p>This, however, may simply be the perspective of someone who's more
used to working in TADS 3 than Inform 7. I suspect that the main
lesson here is that rule-based and object-oriented designs lend
themselves to somewhat different coding strategies, and that one needs
to learn to work with the grain of the system one is employing, rather
than trying to import coding habits from the other system.</p>

<h4 class="subsubhead">The Relative Complexity of the TADS 3 World
Model</h4>

<p>The other difference between TADS 3 and Inform 7 that is frequently
remarked upon is that TADS 3's world model is far more complex. While
this is true to an extent, it is often exaggerated and sometimes
misunderstood.</p>

<p>First, some of the supposed additional complexity of TADS 3 is more
real than apparent. For one thing, since TADS 3 follows a consistently
object-oriented approach, it necessarily has a much richer class
library than Inform 7, since it is using objects and classes to do
jobs that Inform 7 performs in other ways. There are, for example,
quite a few classes TADS 3 uses for parsing and object resolution;
likewise, TADS 3 actions are implemented as classes. Again, TADS 3
often uses classes to do what Inform 7 does with propeties. So, for
example, TADS 3 has a Container class where Inform 7 has a container
kind. TADS 3 then has a number of subclasses of Container to provide
what Inform 7 implements through container properties. A TADS 3
OpenableContainer (a subclass of Container) is equivalent in
functionality to an Inform 7 openable container (a container with the
openable property).</p>

<p>Secondly, when it comes to making a comparison of available
features, the question arises what exactly we should compare with
what. A statement to the effect that TADS 3 provides a much richer
world model than Inform 7 probably has in mind that that the standard
TADS 3 library (adv3) provides a much richer world model than Inform
7's Standard Rules, which is true, but not exactly the whole
story. For one thing, in practice an author writing a game of any
complexity in either system is likely to use one or more extensions,
which are entirely straightforward to include in either system, but
which then add functionality beyond that of the base library. For
another, Inform 7 comes with a large number of examples (presented
throughout "Writing With Inform" and organized more topically in "The
Reciple Book"), which the authors of Inform 7 regard as providing an
extended code library by other means (the user of Inform 7 is actively
invited to copy and paste code from the examples into his or her own
project). In the interests of clarity we should therefore take a
detour through extensions and examples before proceeding to a
comparison of the features offered by TADS 3 and Inform 7.</p>

<p>Both the standard TADS 3 and the standard Inform 7 installations
come supplied with a number of extensions, and further third-party
extensions are available for both systems. Inform 7 does a rather
better job than TADS 3 of actively promoting the use of both standard
and third-party extensions, both through the Inform 7 Extensions web
page and the integration of extensions into the documentation pane of
the IDE. Also, Inform 7 provides a more coherent set of extensions as
standard, seemingly selected to offer commonly needed kinds of
functionality which can be added to projects with a simple "Include"
statement (some of these extensions, like Emily Short's Plurality and
Basic Screen Effects are so widely useful that one half wonders why
they weren't included in the Standard Rules). On the other hand, the
extensions that come included with TADS 3 are a rather more ad-hoc
collection, for which I myself am almost entirely to blame, since in
the main Mike Roberts has simply included the extensions I asked him
to, the main principles of selection being either (a) that the
extension was written by Mike Roberts or (b) that the extension is
referred to in some piece of documentation I've written (that said,
these are extensions I hope many authors will find genuinely
useful). In the main, though, it's probably fair to say that many of
the extensions supplied with Inform 7 provide fairly basic
functionality that comes already included in the TADS 3 standard
library, while many of the extensions that come with TADS 3 offer
further sophistication to the already highly sophisticated adv3
library. To a lesser extent the same could be said of many of the
third-party extensions available for both systems, although there are
some TADS 3 extensions designed to give Inform 7 like features such as
rules, relations and pathfinding to TADS 3, as well as a number of
Inform 7 extensions design to give TADS-like features to Inform 7.</p>

<p>The Inform examples (to which there is no direct TADS 3 equivalent)
are a further complication. So far as I can see, they are intended to
perform a double, if not a triple role. On the other hand they are
clearly part of the documentation, and are clearly presented as
such. Within the documentation they seem to wear a double aspect. In
the context of "Writing with Inform" they seem primarily designed to
illustrate the subject matter of the section in which they're
located. In the context of the Recipe Book they seem more intended to
show how to implement all sorts of clever and ingenious things like
ropes, fires, liquids, and looking from one room into another. Yet the
introduction to the Recipe Book suggests that, at least in this
context, the examples are not there simply to be perused, but to be
copied and pasted into user code in order to implement the
functionality they illustrate. Potentially, they offer a world-model
far richer and more complex than that provided by the Standard
Rules.</p>

<p>Some qualification of this claim would seem to be in order,
however. The adv3 library that comes with TADS 3 is an integrated
whole, with all parts designed to work together. One can thus fairly
speak of <i>the</i> TADS 3 world model. It is far less clear to me
that one could cut and paste code from all the Inform 7 examples and
end up with a coherent world model where all the parts would work
together in the same way, so I'm not all sure one can speak of
<i>the</i> world model provided by the examples. Indeed, presumably
much of the point of providing functionality this way is to allow game
authors to mix and match just the bits they need for their games, so
that each game can end up with a world model tailored to its own
particular needs.</p>

<p>A further consideration is the relative convenience to the user of
having a fairly rich world model supplied in a ready-made code library
(as in TADS 3) as against having a potentially rich (and somewhat
variable) world model supplied largely in the form of a set of
examples from which users are invited to copy and paste code snippets
as needed. While Inform 7 users are free to pick and choose the bits
they want to use, they must then do some work to locate the relevant
example, understand it well enough to identify the code needed, and
then perhaps to adapt it for use in their own code. My suspicion is
that this will often feel like more work than using some feature
already incorporated in the TADS 3 library. To be sure, the TADS 3
author still has to identify which library class or function to use,
and then to gain a sufficient understanding of it from the
documentation to make effective use of it, but in general I feel this
is probably a bit less work (although this may be due to my greater
familiarity with TADS 3). This may partly be a documentation issue: at
least to me, it feels that the TADS 3 Library Reference Manual makes
it easier to find what I want quickly and gain a basic understanding
of it than the Inform 7 Recipe Book. But this is only part of the
reason. With TADS 3 the code is already in place in the library
without any further work on my part, and I don't necessarily have to
gain any great understanding of how it works so long as I know what it
does. Often I can read the documentation to see which properties and
methods I need to override, and treat the rest of it as a black box
whose inner workings need not concern me. I'd be more nervous about
treating code copied from an example in quite the same way.</p>

<p>To the game author who doesn't mind the work of locating the
relevant example, taking the trouble to understand it, and then
adapting it for use into his or her own code, the Inform 7 examples
undoubtedly provide a veritable treasure trove of ingenious solutions,
many of which provide functionality not found in the adv3 library. And
to be fair, many of the example are neither that hard to find, nor
that hard to understand or adapt. Again, it may arguably be a good
thing to make authors think about what features they actually need or
want to include in their particular projects rather than simply using
what's there because there's so much of it; in some respects a
poorly-written TADS 3 game can feel clunkier than a poorly-written
Inform 7 game simply because there's more depth of under-implemented
world model, while the sparseness of an under-implemented Inform game
may get away with masquerading as stylish economy. On the other hand
it would, I think, be a misperception to regard the richer world model
supplied by TADS 3 as necessarily more rigid just because so much more
of it is provided in an integrated form. The TADS 3 language makes it
reasonably straightforward to modify and override any library class,
method or property in one's own code, so that if the library
implementation doesn't do what you want, it's generally possible (and
frequently not all that difficult) to change it.</p>

<p>But the point I'm concerned to establish here is not so much
whether the Inform 7 examples are a good or a bad way of providing
library code, but what should be compared with what in discussing the
alleged greater complexity of the TADS 3 world model.  For the
purposes of an initial comparison it may be best to stick to TADS 3
with its standard adv3 library (and no more) and Inform 7 with the
Standard Rules (and no more). Clearly this is not a comparison of the
full capabilities of the two systems, but it is a comparison of what
they supply by default, or, perhaps more accurately, a comparison of
what each system offers as its <i>minimal</i> feature set (minimal,
that is, without an author actively trying to reduce the feature set
by suppressing all or part of adv3 or the Standard Rules). The
comparison is thus between what we might call "minimal TADS 3" and
"minimal Inform 7" (or perhaps "default TADS 3" and "default Inform
7").</p>

<p>The reason for choosing to compare systems in their minimal (or
default) form is fourfold: (a) it provides a conveniently fixed base
point &mdash; once one allows the addition of extensions and examples
its not clear where to stop, and the comparison risks becoming
somewhat arbitrary; (b) it serves to illustrate the difference in
design philosophies between the two systems; (c) it should help us
more clearly define the perceived complexity of the TADS 3 world model
relative to Inform 7; and (d) it seems to be this comparison that many
people have in mind in stating that the TADS 3 world model is
significantly more complex that than of Inform 7, so it is probably
worth unpacking this widely-held view on the basis of what the people
who make it most probably have in mind.</p>

<p> The following lists make no claim to be exhaustive,
but should contain the most significant distinctive features of each
system in its minimal form:</p>

<ul>
<li>A sophisticated built-in conversation system</li>
<li>The AgendaItem mechanism for directing NPC actions</li>
<li>Items have weight and bulk, and containment can be limited by weight and/or bulk</li>
<li>Items can be contained under and behind others (as well as in or on)</li>
<li>Complex Containers simulate multiple types of containment in the same object (e.g. a bed you can put things both on and under; they do this by combining a number of different objects, each with only one type of containment, a Surface plus a Container say, and making them appear to the player to be a single object)</li>
<li>Room Parts (walls, floor, ceiling or roof) as standard, along with different types of Room (e.g. indoor and outdoor), and the ability to associate particular objects with a particular room part (e.g. a painting hanging on the north wall)</li>
<li>Postures (actors are either standing, sitting, or lying) along with correspondingly different types of enterable supporters (platforms, chairs and beds)</li>
<li>Multiple lighting levels (not just light or dark)</li>
<li>Sophisticated Sense passing (allowing not only passing sensory information between locations but controlling how it is passed)</li>
<li>Sensory Emanations (objects that represent smells and sounds)</li>
<li>Sensory Events (which observers can react to)</li>
<li>Lockable objects (doors and containers) can be locked/unlocked with multiple keys or none (I7 assumes each lockable has one and only one matching key).</li>
<li>An adaptive hints system</li>
<li>A number of different scoring mechanisms, one of which has the ability to automate the calculation of the maximum score</li>
<li>A number of special classes such as LightSource, Flashlight, Button, Lever and Dial that provide functionality that has to be custom-coded in Inform 7</li>
<li>The ability to create objects dynamically</li>
<li>The ability to switch narration between the present and past tenses, and between the first, second and third persons</li>
<li>Floating point maths, with a range of values from 10<sup>32767</sup> to 10<sup>-32767</sup> and up to 65,000 decimal digits in a value</li>
<li>Buffering textual output through the transcript</li>
<li>A wide range of built-in (and easily extensible) implicit actions (automatically picking up objects before putting them somewhere, opening doors before going through them and the like)</li>
</ul>


<p>Some I7 features not in minimal TADS 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scenes</li>
<li>Regions</li>
<li>Relations</li>
<li>Path-finding (through the map or through other relations) [but note that while path-finding isn't built into TADS 3, it is supplied in an extension that forms part of the standard TADS 3 distribution]</li>
<li>The concept of one object being part of another (without being contained within it, as a TADS 3 Component is)</li>
<li>Keeping track of the time of day</li>
<li>Scheduling events to occur at a particular time of day</li>
<li>Tables (though a variety of TADS 3 data structures can be used to offer broadly the same functionality)</li>
<li>User-defined values (above and beyond the TADS 3 enums) and units</li>
<li>Creation of an EPS game map from game code</li>
</ul>

<p>A pattern emerges from these lists, in that the TADS 3 features
that minimal I7 lacks tend to have more to do with concrete details of
the physical world model than the I7 features that minimal TADS 3
lacks, which tend to be at a more abstract level. This largely
reflects the difference in design philosophy between the two systems:
in particular, Inform deliberately opts for a minimalistic default
world-model in order to encourage game authors to build their own or
choose a suitable extension, thus promoting variety and
experimentation, or else to mix and match what they need from the code
supplied in the examples in order to provide a solution more closely
tailored to a particular game. The fact that the TADS 3 list appears
longer than the Inform 7 does not mean that TADS 3 is better than
Inform 7, not least because not all these features are of equal
significance. More to the point, not all are equally relevant to any
particular project an author may have in mind, and several of the
missing ones in either system may be relatively easy to add via an
extension or custom code (or, in the case of Inform 7, code taken from
one of the supplied examples). However, other things being equal, it
may make sense to pick the system for which the default list of
features best meets the needs of the project in hand.</p>

<p>This is not the place to explore all these features in depth, but
it may be worth briefly expanding on a couple of them, taking one from
each list. I'll start with the Inform 7 part-of relation, since it may
not be immediately obvious how an Inform 7 part differs from a TADS 3
Component. At first sight, the following Inform 7 and TADS code
snippets might look equivalent:</p>

<div class="i7code">
[Inform 7 Version]<br />
The brown suitcase is an openable container.<br />
<br />
The carrying handle is part of the brown suitcase.<br />
<br />
/* TADS 3 Version */<br />
suitcase: OpenableContainer 'brown suitcase' 'brown suitcase';<br />
<br />
+ handle: Component 'carrying handle' 'carrying handle';<br />
</div>

<p>In fact, however, whereas the Inform 7 version is fine, the TADS 3
version is a typical beginner's blunder. Inform 7 will assume that the
handle is attached to the outside of the suitcase, which is presumably
what the author intended. TADS 3, however, will consider the handle to
be <i>inside</i> the suitcase (since this is what the programmer has
in fact coded by using the containment relationship to associate the
handle with the case) so that the handle will be out of scope when the
suitcase is closed. The right way of coding the TADS 3 version takes a
little more work:</p>

<div class="i7code">
suitcase: ComplexContainer 'brown suitcase' 'brown suitcase'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subContainer: ComplexComponent, OpenableContainer { }
;<br />
<br />
+ handle: Component 'carrying handle' 'carrying handle';
</div>

<p>This is fine, but it's all too easy to forget to do it this way,
particularly if one first creates the suitcase as an OpenableContainer
and subsequently decides to add a handle at a later date. In this
instance the Inform 7 way of doing things makes life quite a bit
easier for the game author.</p>

<p>From the TADS 3 feature list I'll just briefly expand on the point
about buffering through the transcript. In a TADS 3 game virtually no
text is output directly to the screen. Instead, any text that the
program code tries to output is stored in a list of report objects
that collectively form the transcript. This is then typically output
to the screen once per turn, with game and library code first having
the opportunity to massage the text from the various report objects
before displaying them. A game author could use this, for example, to
summarize a number of reports into a single report: "You take seven
coins" rather than seven instances of "<b>Coin:</b> Taken" one after
the other. The library principally uses it to combine implicit action
reports, for example "(first unlocking the door with the brass key,
then opening it)" and to distinguish failed implicit actions from
successful ones, for example displaying "(first trying to open the
door)" rather than the potentially misleading "(first opening the
door)" when the door did not in fact open. This allows a slightly
neater output than is readily possible with Inform 7 (even with my
Implicit Actions extension), and also leads quite neatly into the next
section.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">Parsing and Action Handling Differences</h3>

<p>My discussion of the more obvious differences between TADS 3 and
Inform 7 ended with some of the more subtle ones. A lot of these more
subtle differences have to do with how the two systems handle parsing,
object resolution and action responses. This is best discussed by
means of an illustration. Suppose we have a minimal game with a single
room, one supporter, one container, and a number of objects with
potentially confusable names. Let's see how this might be handled by
first Inform 7 and then TADS 3.</p>

<h4 class="subhead">The Inform 7 Version</h4>

<div class="i7code">
The Kitchen is a room. "A brown door leads north and a black door
south. There's a cabinet mounted on the wall."<br />
<br />
The table is a supporter in the Kitchen.<br />
<br />
On the table are an orange, an orange mug, and a brown mug.<br />
The orange is edible.<br />
<br />
The cabinet is a closed scenery openable container in the Kitchen.<br />
<br />
A door is usually scenery.<br />
<br />
The brown door is an openable door. It is north of the Kitchen.<br />
The black door is an openable door. It is south of the Kitchen.
</div>

<p>From this we might get a transcript like this:</p>

<p><b>&gt;take orange</b><br />
Which do you mean, the orange or the orange mug?</p>

<p><b>&gt;take mug</b><br />
Which do you mean, the orange mug or the brown mug?</p>

<p><b>&gt;orange</b><br />
Taken.

<p><b>&gt;take brown</b><br />
(the brown mug)<br />
Taken.</p>

<p><b>&gt;open brown</b><br />
(the brown mug)<br />
That's not something you can open.</p>

<p><b>&gt;drop brown</b><br />
(the brown mug)<br />
Dropped.</p>

<p><b>&gt;open brown</b><br />
(the brown mug)<br />
That's not something you can open.</p>

<p><b>&gt;open brown door</b><br />
You open the brown door.</p>

<p><b>&gt;close door</b><br />
Which do you mean, the brown door or the black door?</p>

<p><b>&gt;brown</b><br />
You close the brown door.</p>

<p><b>&gt;put brown in cabinet</b><br />
(the brown mug in the cabinet)<br />
You need to be holding the brown mug before you can put it into something else.</p>

<p><b>&gt;take brown</b><br />
(the brown mug)<br />
Taken.</p>

<p><b>&gt;put brown in cabinet</b><br />
(the brown mug in the cabinet)<br />
The cabinet is closed.</p>

<p><b>&gt;open cabinet</b><br />
You open the cabinet.</p>

<p><b>&gt;put brown in cabinet</b><br />
(the brown mug in the cabinet)<br />
You put the brown mug into the cabinet.</p>

<h4 class="subsubhead">The TADS 3 Version</h4>
<p>The TADS 3 equivalent would be:</p>

<div class="i7code">
me: Actor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;location = kitchen<br />
;<br />
<br />
kitchen: Room 'Kitchen'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;"A brown door leads north and a black door south. Theres a cabinet mounted on the wall. "<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;north = brownDoor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;south = blackDoor<br />
;<br />
<br />
+ brownDoor: Door 'brown door' 'brown door';<br />
<br />
+ blackDoor: Door 'black door' 'black door';<br />
<br />
+ Surface, Heavy 'table' 'table';<br />
<br />
++ Food 'orange' 'orange';<br />
<br />
++ Thing 'orange mug' 'orange mug';<br />
<br />
++ Thing 'brown mug' 'brown mug';<br />
<br />
++ OpenableContainer, Fixture 'cabinet' 'cabinet';
</div>

<p>From which the equivalent transcript might look like this:</p>

<p>&gt;<b>take orange</b><br />
Taken.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>take mug</b><br />
Which mug do you mean, the brown mug, or the orange mug?</p>

<p>&gt;<b>orange</b><br />
Taken.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>take brown</b><br />
Taken.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>open brown</b><br />
Opened.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>drop brown</b><br />
Dropped.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>close door</b><br />
Closed.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>put brown in cabinet</b><br />
(first taking the brown mug, then opening the cabinet)<br />
Done.</p>

<h4 class="subsubhead">The Versions Compared</h4>

<p>At a first approximation, the TADS 3 version is better at doing
what the player wants without making a fuss about it, while the Inform
7 version is better at telling the player what it's doing.</p>

<p>When it comes to choosing between the orange (fruit) and the orange
mug, Inform 7 leaves the player no way to refer to the fruit (of course
this can be fixed with a "does the player mean" statement or by using
Jon Ingold's Disambiguation Control extension; I'm just comparing how
things work "out of the box"). For the TADS 3 version this isn't a
problem, since the TADS 3 parser recognizes "orange" in "orange mug"
as an adjective and automatically prefers the noun match. This is an
advantage in most typical cases, but makes it a bit harder to define
objects described by non-standard noun phrases such as "the path to
the north" (which an I7 Understand statement would have no
particular difficulty with).</p>

<p>The TADS 3 parser is smart enough to work out that the mugs (but
not the doors) are portable while the doors (but not the mugs) are
openable, so that TAKE and DROP probably refer to the former and OPEN
and CLOSE to the latter. This allows TADS 3 to avoid a whole lot of
disambiguation questions asked by Inform 7. The TADS 3 parser also
knows it's more logical to close an open door than a closed one, so it
avoids asking which door the player means in response to CLOSE DOOR
when only one door is open. On the other hand TADS 3's responses to
these actions are so laconic that it may not be immediately obvious to
the player what effect his/her command has just had.</p>

<p>Finally (in this example), TADS 3 does a much better job of
handling PUT BROWN IN CABINET by performing a sequence of implicit
actions rather than forcing players explicitly to do the obvious
intermediate actions of taking the brown mug and opening the
cabinet. TADS 3 also neatly gathers all the explicit action reports
together into a single parenthesised summary. Although much of this
functionality can be made available in Inform 7 by using my Implicit
Actions extension, the TADS 3 implementation is more robust and, I
think, easier to customize for exceptional cases. Part of the reason
for that is that TADS 3 buffers all output through what it calls the
"transcript" before displaying it on the screen, so that, for example,
it can gather all implicit action reports into one before displaying
them. My Inform 7 Implicit Actions extensions tries to do the same
thing, but (a) can't manage every case and (b) comes horribly unstuck
if used in conjuction with a debugging command like RULES, which could
then try to write to the temporary text buffer with potentially
catastrophic results.</p>

<p>That said, one can certainly add in many of the TADS 3 features
mentioned above into an I7 game using extensions and various language
features, just as one can make the TADS 3 version give better feedback
on how it is interpreting the player's commands. Moreover, just
because there are clear differences in the way the two systems behave,
it doesn't mean that those differences are always important. In many
games the behaviour of one system or the other 'out of the box' or
with easily included extensions may be quite good enough. Nonetheless
there are differences here: in the foregoing example, the TADS 3
version is arguably giving players a smoother player experience than
the I7 version; or, to put it another way, the I7 author has a bit
more work to do to make the I7 version carry out the intelligent
disambiguation and implicit actions that come as standard with TADS
3.</p>

<p>It's also arguably the case that the TADS 3 implementation of these
features is easier to customize than the I7 equivalents (though this
perception may be due to my greater familiarity with TADS 3). For
example, while in I7 you have to specify in an action definition
whether objects need to be touchable or visible for that action, or
whether the action applies to something preferably held, in TADS 3
this is defined on the class or object by the same mechanism that
triggers implicit actions. So, for example, if I need to be holding
the pen but not the mountain to show one or the other object to an
actor, I can define an objHeld precondition on the pen and a
objVisible precondition on the mountain (for the ShowTo
action). Ultimately, it is perhaps a matter of taste whether this is
more straightforward than carrying out the equivalent job in Inform 7
(for which see Emily Short's <a href="http://emshort.wordpress.com/2008/10/23/the-aesthetics-of-if-languages/">final post in the 'Aesthetics of IF
Languages' thread on her blog</a>).</p>

<p>Likewise, although Jon Ingold's Disambiguation Control extension
goes a considerable way to closing the gap, I'm inclined to think that
TADS 3's verify() methods provide rather a neat way to do what one
needs a combination of check rules and "does the player mean" rules in
Inform 7, and ends up with something that's arguably a bit more
flexible (or, to put it another way), something that allows finer
degrees of control). The TADS 3 standard library takes full advantage
of this to implement the kind of out-of-the-box intelligent
disambiguation illustrated above (although it's clear that the I7 has
at least some equivalent features built in). Once one wants to move
beyond the standard library default behaviour, though, some authors
may find optimal use of TADS 3 verify statements harder to master than
that of I7's check and 'does the player mean' rules.</p>

<p>One further parsing feature this example did not illustrate is that
the TADS 3 parser is better able that Inform 7's to cope with this
kind of disambiguation nightmare:</p>

<p><b>&gt;take apple</b><br />
Which did you mean, the apple, the apple or the apple?</p>

<p><b>&gt;take box</b><br />
Which did you mean, the small box or the box?</p>

<p>In the first case the player of the Inform 7 version would have no
way to tell the parser which apple she wanted, and so would be left
unable to take any apple. In the second case the Inform 7 player would
be able to take the small box, but not the box. The player of the TADS
3 version would not be so stymied, however, since she could specify
which she meant with a response like "the first", "the second" or
"the last", referring to the position of the desired object in the
disambiguation list. Analogous functionality can be added to Inform 7
using Aaron Reed's "Numbered Disambiguation Choices" extension, but
once again we are comparing what each system offers out of the
box.</p>

<h4 class="subsubhead">A Further Parsing Example &mdash; Locative Qualifiers</h4>

<p>The TADS 3 parser is also a little smarter at recognizing locative
qualifies such as 'on the table' or 'in the box'. This may be
illustrated by a further pair of transcripts from the same small game
we've already been considering. Here's the transcript from the TADS 3
Version:</p>

<p><b>Kitchen</b><br />
A brown door leads north and a black door south. There's a cabinet mounted on the wall.<br /> 
<br />
On the table are an orange, an orange mug, and a brown mug.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>put orange mug in cabinet</b><br />
(first taking the orange mug, then opening the cabinet)<br />
Done.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>take mug on table</b><br />
Taken.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>take mug in cabinet</b><br />
Taken.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>put brown on table</b><br />
You put the brown mug on the table.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>x mug on table</b><br />
You see nothing unusual about it.</p> 


<p>Inform 7 struggles with this a bit, as the following I7 version transcript illustrates:</p>

<p><b>Kitchen</b><br />
A brown door leads north and a black door south. There's a cabinet mounted on the wall.<br />
<br />
You can see a table (on which are an orange, an orange mug and a brown mug) here.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>take orange mug</b><br />
Taken.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>open cabinet</b><br />
You open the cabinet.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>put mug in cabinet</b><br />
(the orange mug in the cabinet)<br />
You put the orange mug into the cabinet.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>take mug on table</b><br />
You can't see any such thing.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>take mug from table</b><br />
Taken.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>take mug in cabinet</b><br />
You can't see any such thing.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>take mug from cabinet</b><br />
Taken.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>put brown mug on table</b><br />
You put the brown mug on the table.</p>

<p>&gt;<b>x mug on table</b><br />
You can't see any such thing.</p>

<p>To be sure, it would be possible to make the Inform 7 version work
more like the TADS 3 version here by taking advantage of Inform 7's
capability to understand things by relations. The relevant example
from the Inform 7 documentation is:</p>

<div class="i7code">
A box is a kind of container. Understand "box in [something related by reversed 
containment]" as a box. 
</div>

<p>The point is not that Inform 7 is unable to match the TADS 3's
locative-qualifier parsing, but that it does not do so out of the box,
so that once again the author may have to do more work. On the other
hands, Inform 7's more generalized understanding by relation may allow
other kinds of parser trick not so easily implemented in TADS 3.

<h4 class="subsubhead">Parser Flexibility</h4>

<p>Although the last few examples have largely stressed TADS 3's
advantages over Inform 7, when it comes to parsing issues the
advantages are not all one side. In many cases Inform 7 is more
flexible, at least to the extent of making it easier for the author to
deal with special cases. For example, in <i>Nightfall</i> there is a
single doorbell, and for that object alone it makes sense to treat
RING BELL as equivalent to PUSH BELL. Inform 7 handles this with
elegant simplicity:</p>

<div class="i7code">Understand "ring [bell]" as pushing.</div>

<p>If there's a way of doing this in TADS 3 I have yet to discover
it. In particular there may be some way of defining new tokens of
grammar in TADS 3, but that aspect of the parser is totally opaque to
me, whereas in a case like the above, in I7 it is completely
straightforward. In TADS 3 one would have to define a new ring action
plus its grammar, plus its default behaviour on the Thing class, and
then finally on the bell add a line like:</p>

<div class="i7code">dobjFor(Ring) asDobjFor(Push)</div>

<p>This is doable, but a lot more work.</p>

<p>Likewise, Inform 7 makes it easier to define vocabulary words that
may or may not refer to an object depending on its state. For example,
in Inform 7 we can define:</p>

<div class="i7code">
The vase can be broken or unbroken.<br />
Understand the unbroken property as describing the vase.
</div>

<p>There are several ways one can achieve the same effect in TADS 3,
but all of them involve more busywork than the Inform 7
method. Perhaps the most robust of the TADS 3 approaches would be
along the following lines:</p>

<div class="i7code">
brokenState: ThingState<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;stateTokens = ['broken']<br />
;<br />
<br />
unbrokenState: ThingState<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;stateTokens = ['unbroken']<br />
;<br />
<br />
vase: Container 'broken unbroken vase' 'vase'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;allStates = [brokenState, unbrokenState]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;getState = (isBroken ? brokenState: unbrokenState)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;isBroken = nil<br />
;
</div>

<p>To be sure, this is not too bad, but gives the TADS 3 author rather
more work to do than the Inform 7 author. The difference would, of
course, become less significant in a game that contained several
objects that could be either broken or unbroken, since the ThingState
objects would only need to be defined once for the whole set of
objects, and it may be that the ThingState objects could be used for
further purposes that could not so readily be achieved with Inform 7's
broken/unbroken property. The fact nevertheless remains that Inform 7
seems generally more nimble-footed when it comes to this kind of
one-off special case.</p>


<h3 class="subhead">Conclusions</h3>

<p>This comparison between TADS 3 and Inform 7 is probably more than
long enough for most readers, even though it is far from comprehensive
(the only way to make a fully comprehensive comparison would be to
study the full set of documentation supplied by each system). Again,
while I have tried to be as fair as I can, no more than any other
writer can I claim to be entirely neutral, objective and free of
bias. The fact is that I know TADS 3 better than I know Inform 7; I
have written four substantial games and several smaller ones in TADS
3, but only one substantial Inform 7 game (<i>Nightfall</i>) and one
very small one (<i>Dreadwine</i>); in addition I have written a
substantial amount of documentation for TADS 3 but none at all for
Inform 7. It would be surprising if that didn't give me some pro-TADS
3 biases, if only because in some places I have a much better
understanding of how TADS 3 goes about things than how Inform 7 does,
which in turn could well make the TADS 3 way of going about certain
things appear clearer or better structured to me. Rather than pretend
to be unbiased, the honest course is to make sure the reader is aware
f my biases.</p>

<p>I am not, in any case, trying to argue that TADS 3 is better than
Inform 7, any more than I am trying to argue the reverse. In fact, I
find it very difficult to sum up what I feel the difference between
them to be in any neat formulation that isn't more misleading than
helpful. I do not think it is the case, as some have suggested, that
TADS 3 is better for simulation-intensive games and Inform 7 is a
better story-telling medium (though I understand why some people may
have that perception). This comparison underplays both Inform 7's
simulation capabilities and the narrative potential of TADS 3's great
NPCs and conversation tools. I might be tempted to say that it
sometimes feel as if Inform 7 can be more flexible and TADS 3 more
robust, but it would be misleading to suggest either that Inform 7
lacks robustness or that TADS 3 lacks flexibility. What I perhaps have
in mind is that Inform 7 sometimes lets authors get away with
short-cuts that TADS 3 would tend to disallow, demanding that the
author take a more robustly systematic approach, but no doubt anyone
could quickly come up with half a dozen exceptions even to this
generalization, and here my gut perception may in any case differ from
that of other people. Even if my generalization were in any sense
correct, it would not make one system better than the other; at most
it might make one more suited to a particular author's
preferences.</p>

<p>Many games can be equally well implemented in either system, and
the quality of games produced with either system will depend far more
heavily on the skill and application of the author than on the choice
of system. Moreover, most people who write interactive fiction do so
largely for fun, so it makes perfect sense to choose whichever system
you feel most comfortable with, or whichever you most enjoy working
with. On the assumption that you're facing a genuine choice between
Inform 7 and TADS 3, however, there are some factors that may make one
system or the other a better choice for the particular kind of game
you want to write.</p>

<p>Other things being equal, it makes sense to ask which set of
features distinctive to either system is most important to the type of
game you have in mind. If, for example, you are planning a game in
which room parts, postures, sense passing and TADS 3 style
conversation are all going to play a significant role, then it makes
better sense to use TADS 3 than to attempt to graft all these features
onto Inform 7. Conversely if you're writing a game that makes little
use of the more specialized parts of the TADS 3 world model, but which
could benefit from using the Inform 7 scenes mechanism then Inform 7
is probably the better choice. Sometimes the choice may appear less
clear-cut. It should in any case be borne in mind that quite a few
TADS features (implicit actions, limiting capacity by bulk and so
forth) can easily be added to an Inform 7 via an extension, and many
others are reasonably easy to code in Inform 7. Ultimately it will be
a matter of individual judgement where the tipping point comes; that
is, where it becomes better to use the features built into TADS 3
rather than trying to add them to Inform 7. If nothing else, built-in
features are likely to have the advantages of being better integrated
into their respective libraries and more thoroughly
tested. Conversely, if you positively do not want some of the more
arcane features supplied by the TADS 3 world model, say, because your
game is better suited to a leaner or different world model, then you
are likely to be better off building your own world model in Inform 7
then trying to suppress the unwanted or contrary features in TADS
3.</p>

<p>Size, speed and portability can also be relevant considerations. A
fully-featured HTML TADS interpreter is currently available only for
Windows, although text-mode TADS interpreters are available for other
systems. Glulx interpreters are available for a wider range of
systems, but there currently seem to be some issues over how well all
of them support all of Inform 7's features. On the other hand, z-code
interpreters are available for a wide range of interpreters. Other
things being equal, this may make Inform 7 the better choice for a
game that is going to be small enough to fit into Z-Code (although it
may not always be easy to judge whether this will turn out to be the
case). The fact that smaller games are less likely to call on all the
features of the TADS 3 library would tend to reinforce this
choice.</p>

<p>As the projected game gets larger, so TADS 3 may gain some
advantage. In a large game, the ability to split the game code over
separate TADS 3 source files becomes increasingly valuable. The point
is not so much ease of finding one's way around one's code &mdash;
opinions will vary over whether that's made easier by splitting source
code over multiple files or by the variety of code-navigation tools
built into the Inform 7 IDE. Rather, the point is that this enables
TADS 3 to recompile a large game very much faster than Inform 7
can. In particular, if you make a small change to your TADS 3 game and
recompile, the compiler only needs to recompile the one or two source
files affected, and the recompilation may seem almost
instantaneous. If you make similar changes to a comparable Inform 7
game and then recompile, the Inform 7 compiler not only has to
recompile the whole game, library and all, but has to translate your
Inform 7 code into Inform 6 code and then compile that. This is
inevitably much slower because the Inform 7 compiler has so much more
to do. To be sure doing a full compile the first time in TADS 3 (or a
full recompile of everything) may not seem much faster that compiling
in Inform 7, but the partial recompilation that one typically employs
in TADS 3 is <i>very</i> much faster, and the speed difference can
feel quite significant if your working method is to recompile and test
each time after a few small changes or additions.</p>

<p> A secondary advantage of TADS 3 in larger games is that the larger
the game, the more objects and other entities it is likely to contain,
and the higher the probabity of creating an unintentional name-clash
error; while the TADS 3 compiler will generally catch such errors, the
Inform 7 compiler may not, resulting in subtle bugs that can be hard
to track down (admittedly this may be less of an issue for the more
experienced Inform 7 author who is wise to the problem and careful to
avoid it).</p>

<p>A comparison of execution speeds of the compiled code is harder to
make, since apart from anything else it's hard to know whether one is
looking at compiler efficiency or interpreter efficiency. It is
notable, for example, that the same Glulx game will run very much
faster on Windows Git than on Windows Glulx. The former can almost
eliminate path-finding delays that are very noticeable on the
latter. That said, my suspicion (which is admittedly not supported by
systematic testing or a huge amount of empirical data) is that
computationally-heavy games, such as ones that do a lot of string
manipulation or regular expression handling, are likely to run a bit
faster in TADS 3. On the other hand, I suspect that only a small
minority of games will be sufficiently computationally heavy for this
difference to be all that significant in practice. (As an example, my
perception is that my GO TO/CONTINUE commands work a bit faster in
<i>Blighted Isle</i> than in <i>Nightfall</i>, though this is partly
because TADS 3 lets me cache the route calculated in GO TO for use in
CONTINUE).</p>

<p>I do think TADS 3 has a slight edge in terms of player interface:
the advantages are quite subtle, but overall the parser is a bit
better at interpreting player input in doubtful cases, the handling of
implicit actions is better at minimizing player frustration, and the
transcript buffering mechanism can make for slightly neater output. I
also think that this edge can be largely blunted by an incompetent
TADS 3 author and largely overcome by a competent Inform 7 one, but
that the TADS 3 probably retains this slight edge over Inform 7 if one
assumes authors of equal competence (or one and the same author using
both systems). I may be influenced in this judgement by the fact that
the paucity of implicit actions (e.g. being forced to explicitly pick
up an object before putting it in or on something) is one of my pet
gripes about the majority of Inform games (whether Inform 7 or Inform
6). In any case I don't think the slight edge TADS 3 has in this
respect is enough to determine any author's choice of system unless
every other consideration ends up very finely balanced.</p>

<p>This article will not persuade anyone already committed either to
TADS 3 or to Inform 7 to switch their allegiance to the other system;
neither do I have the remotest desire to that it should. What I do
hope this article will achieve (if you'll pardon my expressing it this
way) is to help both the choice between systems and discussions of
their relative merits to become a tad better informed.</p>
