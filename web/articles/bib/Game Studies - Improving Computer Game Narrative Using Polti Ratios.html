  <p><span >Computer games are criticised sometimes as
    lacking in narrative. In this paper we introduce a model of stories (Polti
    ratios) into which computer games (meeting particular criteria) can be
    abstracted. Using this model, we designed a process to analyse and explore
    computer game narrative. We give a highly detailed example of applying this
    process to a computer game treatment currently under production called <i>Street Survivor</i>. </span></p>
  <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
  <p><span >The question of whether computer games </span><i><span
 >should</span></i><span
> be analysed using stories has been intensely debated (Frasca,
    2003). This discussion aside, we believe that stories </span><i><span
 >will</span></i><span
> be used for such analysis due partly to their universality. Stories
    have acted as the primary structure of communication for millennia in many
    cultures (Chambers, 1984), and they easily transcend cultural boundaries
    (Colby, Kennedy and Milanesi, 1991). Explanations come from several academic
    Ô¨Åelds. Historians claim that narrative fashions human experience into
    structures of meaning that are generally human rather than culture-speciÔ¨Åc
    (White, 1991). Philosophers have argued that stories have the highest degree of
    structure in the world (Bakhtin, 1981 Holquist, 1990).</span></p>
  <p><span >In addition, psychologists have
    demonstrated that stories play an important role in cognition and in modelling
    the world (Graesser, 1995 Zwaan and Magliano, 1995). S</span><span

  <p><span >However, narrative is not the only tool for
    computer game analysis in town there are other crucial aspects to successful computer
    games such as game playability (Fabricatore et. al., 2002). Nonetheless, within
    the scope of this paper we are going to naively assume that these aspects are
    independent for example, <i>good</i> narrative does not logically imply <i>bad</i> game playability. Integrated models must necessarily explore and define the
    conditions for which such relations hold in order to properly subsume these
    aspects.</span></p>
  <p><span >So we focus on stories, but there are
    hundreds of ways in which stories can be modelled (see the </span><i><span  
>Dictionar</span><span >y </span></i><i><span  
>o</span><span >f </span></i><i><span  
>Narratolog</span><span >y</span></i><span
> </span><span  >Princ</span><span >e, </span><span 
>1987). We wanted
    the model to be described by quantitative measures so that any story, however
    complex, could be boiled down into single numbers. Such reduction can be
    justifiably accused of a corresponding loss of nutrition, for instance, how can <i>good</i> narrative equal a <i>high</i> number? Accordingly, these numbers
    alone will not necessarily show that on</span><span >e </span><span
 >stor</span><span
>y </span><span  >i</span><span >s </span><span  
>‚Äúbetter</span><span >‚Äù </span><span
 >tha</span><span
>n </span><span  >anothe</span><span >r, because there are so many
    dimensions to stories and our measures will ignore many of these. </span><span
 >But
    whatever their drawbacks, and however they are constructed, scores are
    undeniably easy to grasp, discuss and compare.</span><span > </span></p>
  <p><span  >Since </span><span >scores are easy to compare, we could
    possibly exhaustively analyse and compare current popular games, such as <i>The
    Sims</i> or <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>, or go beyond the computer game context
    into other media such as film or literature. But the purpose of this paper is
    to go beyond evaluation our project is to invent a simple and practical way to
    improve the narrative in a computer game design treatment. There are certainly
    aspects of evaluation, but the target audience of this paper is practicians
    rather than theoreticians.</span></p>
  <p><span >The organisation of this paper is as
    follows. In Section 2 we discuss the classes of story model that have been used
    in computational story modelling, under the assumption that such models might
    be amenable to the creation of quantitative measures. The story model we chose
    to describe in terms of these measures has the following three properties: it
    can differentiate between computer games that contain stories and those that do
    not (Section 3) it can be used to specify the characteristics of artificial
    characters in computer games (Section 4), and it can be used to evaluate and
    reconceive stories quantitatively (Section 5). The first property is important
    because a proper story model should be able to distinguish between a story and
    a non-story. The second property is important because our distinguishing
    feature is precisely that stories contain characters and we should be able to
    say what a character is. We then move to application in Section 6 we consider
    a real computer game design treatment (for a game called <i>Street Survivor</i>) as an extended case study. We apply our story
    model to this game and reconceive the story within the model (which was largely
    adopted).</span></p>
  <h3>2. The Appeal of Polti‚Äôs Dramatic Situations</h3>
  <p><span >Computational story models appear to have
    two fundamental characteristics: a certain level of abstraction and a top-down
    or bottom-up construction (from a systems theory point of view). By abstraction
    we mean that components can be defined vaguely (e.g. ‚Äúthe impact was positive‚Äù
    √† la <i>plot units, </i>Lehnert, 1982) or precisely (e.g. ‚ÄúJoe ordered a
    hamburger‚Äù √† la <i>scripts</i>, Schank and Abelson, 1977). By top-down we mean
    that the model defines a sequence of components (like a template) that must be
    filled in (e.g. ‚Äústarting equilibrium, falling event, rising event, turning
    point, final equilibrium‚Äù √† la the <i>Aristotelian model</i>, Cassady, 1991).
    By bottom-up we mean the model defines a number of components that can be
    combined and used in any desired manner (e.g. ‚Äúsubsumption state, cause of
    termination event, problem-state description‚Äù √† la <i>points</i>, Wilensky,
    1982). </span></p>
  <p><span >Within this framework, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirty-Six_Dramatic_Situations"><span
>Polti‚Äô</span><span
>s </span><span 
>situation</span><span >s</span></a> (Polti, 1895 Lucille, 1977, Hall et al, 2000, see
    Appendix 1) are highly abstract but have varying levels of detail. Some
    situations are explicit regarding what happens to whom in what relationships,
    while in others these details are omitted. For an example of an explicit
    situation, consider </span><u><span  
>rivalr</span><span >y </span></u><u><span
 >o</span><span
>f </span></u><u><span  
>superio</span><span >r </span></u><u><span
 >an</span><span
>d </span></u><u><span  
>inferior</span></u><span >. Clearly,
    relations exist between characters and these relations entail norms that should
    not (but are) compromised. For an example of a less explicit situation consider </span><u><span  >erro</span><span >r </span></u><u><span 
>o</span><span
>f </span></u><u><span  
>judgment</span></u><span >. In this
    situation character(s) A makes a mistake of some kind, but no description of
    the mistake is given. It requires the audience to recognise that A has made the
    mistake.</span></p>
  <p><span >In terms of systems theory, Polti‚Äôs
    situations can be characterised largely as bottom-up. Polti does not specify
    how to combine or synthesise his units his project is identifying the minimum
    number of units (reviewing over a thousand stories). Many units do describe
    short causal sequences (e.g. </span><u><span  
>crim</span><span >e </span></u><u><span
 >pursue</span><span
>d </span></u><u><span  
>b</span><span >y </span></u><u><span
 >vengeance</span></u><span
>) that are internally top-down but with respect to the other units
    are bottom-up. In terms of events occurring in a story, it appears that
    multiple units can be concatenated or nested as long as (most of the time) the
    causal sequences are completely represented. For example, <u>pursuit</u> can
    halt temporarily for various reasons.</span></p>
  <p><span >The main advantage of these bottom-up
    abstract units is that they are descriptive, as opposed to prescriptive. They
    essentially provide a pattern language that can be either matched to existing
    stories or used in story authoring. And they help us substantially in our quest
    to create quantitative measures for stories in that these units and their
    components are <i>countable</i>, by and large. But firstly we need to show that
    this model can distinguish between a story and a non-story in particular,
    between a story and a game.</span></p>
  <h3>3. Is It a Game or a Story?</h3>
  <p><span >Some authors distinguish between the two by
    the role of the people engaged (Newman, 2002) and the linearity of the events
    (Lindley, 2005). We‚Äôre going to take a slightly different tack, and initially
    propose the theory that if people can explain what is going on in terms of at
    least one of Polti‚Äôs units then the object that they are engaged with can be
    labelled a story. Since these dramatic situations are extracted from stories,
    this means that if there is a match, then people should be able to point to
    other stories (or genres) which share similar events, and perhaps argue that
    these objects are stories by analogy.</span></p>
  <p><span >We now relate our theory to three levels of
    game abstraction: <i>deÔ¨Ånition, game genre</i> and in terms of an <i>instance</i> <i>Tetris</i>, following previous academic work
    (Ryan, 2001). At the level of </span><i><span  
>deÔ¨Ånition</span></i><span
>, suppose we use a 10-point deÔ¨Ånition of game components (Avedon and
    Sutton-Smith, 1971): 1) purpose of the game, 2) procedure for action, 3) rules
    governing action, 4) number of required participants, 5) roles of participants,
    6) results or pay-off, 7) abilities and skills required for action, 8)
    interaction patterns, 9) physical setting and environmental requirements, 10)
    required equipment. Clearly, game component 6 (results or pay-off), can be
    matched to Polti‚Äôs unit </span><u><span  
>obtaining</span></u><span >, thus
    these categories are blurred.</span></p>
  <p><span >At the level of </span><i><span 
>gam</span></i><span
>e </span><i><span  
>genre</span></i><span >, suppose we
    consider Crawford‚Äôs taxonomy of computer games (Crawford, 1984). His two main categories,
    skill/action games and strategy games, are equally blurred. A number of Polti‚Äôs
    units are easily matched: </span><span  
>th</span><span >e </span><span
 >enigm</span><span
>a (searcher), </span><span  
>pursuit</span><span >, </span><span
 >obtaining</span><span
>, </span><span  >fallin</span><span >g </span><span 
>pre</span><span
>y </span><span  >t</span><span >o </span><span 
>misfortune</span><span
>, </span><span  >ambition</span><span >, </span><span 
>disaster</span><span
>, and </span><span  
>darin</span><span >g </span><span
 >enterprise</span><span
>. Thus games in these genres blur with stories.</span></p>
  <p><span >At the level of </span><i><span 
>instance</span></i><span
>, consider Tetris with respect to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirty-Six_Dramatic_Situations"><span
>Polti‚Äô</span><span
>s </span><span 
>situations</span></a>. It‚Äôs straightforward to
    find at least two matches: </span><u><span  
>obtainin</span><span >g</span></u><span
> the player is continuously losing more and more ground and </span><u><span
 >th</span><span
>e </span></u><u><span  
>enigm</span><span >a</span></u><span
> the player is continuously searching for a way to get rid of all
    the blocks. Murray‚Äôs analogy for this ‚Äúa perfect enactment of the over tasked
    lives of Americans in the 1990s-of the constant bombardment of tasks that
    demand our attention and that we must somehow fit into our overcrowded
    schedules and clear off our desks in order to make room for the next onslaught‚Äù
    (Murray, 1997), has been derided as a projection (Eskelinen, 2001).
    Nonetheless, this analogy matches Polti units, thus both are stories under the
    current theory.</span></p>

  <h3>4. Computer Games with ‚ÄúCharacters‚Äù Have Stories</h3>
  <p><span >In the previous section we made a
    distinction that relied on the concept of a character without deÔ¨Åning what
    characters are. Bringsjord previously proposed that computer generated
    characters should have a minimum of five properties of (philosophical)
    personhood: language, autonomy, creativity, phenomenal consciousness, and
    reasoning capacity, and argued that since artificial autonomy is impossible,
    computer generated characters are impossible (Bringsjord, 2001). Of course, it
    would be great if artificial intelligence advanced to the point where all would
    agree that a program had achieved personhood and we hope that one day it does.
    However, we think Bringsjord is unreasonably raising the bar for characters to
    necessarily require personhood. With characters, the notion of their personhood
    exists only in the mind of an observer of a story. The internal mental state of
    movie actors may not necessarily correlate to their external state.</span></p>
  <p><span >Our speciÔ¨Åcation for characters is far less
    ambitious than what Bringsjord has proposed. Rather than using philosophy as a
    basis, we developed our requirements directly from our story model. That is, we
    systematically identiÔ¨Åed a set of capabilities that characters should <i>appear</i> to have that would allow all of Polti‚Äôs thirty-six dramatic units to be
    realised (Hall, 2002). These capabilities are summarised in Figure 1.</span></p>
  <p><i><span  >Attribute</span><span >s</span></i><span >: All
    attributes of character A which have an e</span><span 
>ff</span><span
>ect external to themselves in the situation should appear to have
    their normal e</span><span  
>ff</span><span >ect. For
    example, if one character can run faster than another, the former would
    normally win a foot race. </span></p>
  <p><i><span  >Perceptio</span><span >n</span></i><span >: A should
    appear to normally perceive their situation perfectly. For example, if A
    perceives their situation incorrectly then they are much more likely to make
    mistakes. </span></p>
  <p><i><span  >Menta</span><span >l </span></i><i><span 
>stat</span><span
>e</span></i><span >: The normal mental state for A should
    appear to be that their aim is to satisfy their goals, and every emotion which
    A has towards other agents reÔ¨Çects a perceived relationship. For example, if
    their actions do not reÔ¨Çect their internal goals then their behaviour would be
    described (in pop psychology) as madness. </span></p>
  <p><i><span  >Pursui</span><span >t</span></i><span >: The
    position of A (being in a speciÔ¨Åc situation) should appear to be normally
    independent of the position of other objects, and A can move freely around in
    and between situations. For example, most </span><i><span 
>A</span></i><span
>s are not continuously pursuing something. </span></p>
  <p><i><span  >Lov</span><span >e</span></i><span >: </span><i><span
 >A</span></i><span
>s should appear to be normally emotionally neutral towards other </span><i><span
 >As</span></i><span
>, unless special circumstances have caused them to exhibit the
    important directed emotions of love or hate. For example, if </span><i><span
 >A</span></i><span
>1 is in love with another, the former will not appreciate the latter
    being removed from those circumstances. </span></p>
  <p><i><span  >Famil</span><span >y</span></i><span >: A should
    appear to not belong to a family with all other characters, and special
    conditions must occur for a family to exist. For example, members of the one
    family happily coexisting in the same situation should not be enemies. </span></p>
  <p><i><span  >Frien</span><span >d</span></i><span >: A should
    appear to be normally friends with characters that they interact with, although
    speciÔ¨Åc interactions can cause them to become enemies. For example, if </span><i><span
 >A</span></i><span
>1 is friends with </span><i><span  
>A</span></i><span >2 but
    enemies with </span><i><span  
>A</span></i><span  
>3</span><span >, </span><i><span
 >A</span></i><span
>1 will not appreciate </span><i><span  
>A</span></i><span >2 being
    friends with </span><i><span  
>A</span></i><span  
>3</span><span >. </span></p>
  <p><i><span  >Powe</span><span >r</span></i><span >: A should
    appear to normally not have power over other </span><i><span 
>A</span></i><span
>, although A may often be involved in power structures where they or
    others have power. For example, if </span><i><span  
>A</span></i><span >1 has
    power over </span><i><span  >A</span></i><span  >2</span><span >, </span><i><span 
>A</span></i><span
>1 does not expect </span><i><span  
>A</span></i><span >2 to try
    to gain power over </span><i><span  
>A</span></i><span  
>1</span><span >. </span></p>
  <p><i><span  >Exchang</span><span >e</span></i><span >: A
    should appear to normally not exchange objects with other actors. Transactions
    of objects do occur between situations, but not always according to the wishes
    of the A involved. </span></p>
  <p><i><span  >Intentio</span><span >n</span></i><span >: A
    normally tries to produce the outcomes they desire. However there are four
    possible reasons for action from the point of view of actors: choice, accident,
    necessity, or irrelevant. Irrelevant means that the source of the deterministic
    cause is not important. </span></p>
  <p><span >Figure 1: Character capabilities</span></p>
  <p><span >We believe that Bringsjord‚Äôs call for game
    designers ‚Äúto impel gamers to believe they are interacting with virtual people‚Äù
    is unnecessary. Dramatically compelling entertainment, by deÔ¨Ånition, must be
    able to be achieved via the realisation of Polti‚Äôs dramatic situations.
    Computer games with characters with any of the above capabilities, who
    represent corresponding Polti units, are thus computer games with narrative by
    our account.</span></p>
  <h3>5. Using Polti Ratios to Evaluate and Improve Stories</h3>
  <p><span >In this paper we evaluate stories in terms
    of simple measures related to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirty-Six_Dramatic_Situations"><span
>Polti‚Äô</span><span
>s </span><span 
>dramati</span><span >c </span><span >situations</span></a>. We use ratios because they are supposedly the
    most informative scale (Reich, 1995). We‚Äôve already broadly defined a story as
    events in which people can identify at least one of Polti‚Äôs dramatic
    situations. Intuitively, a small number of events, <i>E</i>, with a large number of Polti‚Äôs
    units, <i>P</i>, correspond
    with the notion of an intensely dramatic story but a small number of Polti‚Äôs
    units with a large number of events correspond to a dull story. </span></p>
  <p><i><span  
>Leve</span></i><span >l </span><i><span
 >o</span></i><span
>f </span><i><span  
>Drama</span></i><span 
>(</span><i><span
 >LoD</span></i><span
 >)</span><span
>= </span><i><span  
>P/</span><span >E</span></i><span
> </span></p>
  <p><span >So how does this relate to games generally
    and computer games speciÔ¨Åcally? In most games, there is potential for <i>E</i>‚Ü'‚àû,
    thus LoD‚Ü'0. With <i>Tetris</i>, even
    with at least </span><i><span  
>P</span></i><span >=2, because <i>E</i>‚Ü'‚àû,</span><i><sub><span
 

> </span></sub></i><span >LoD is still zero. Note
    that, as time goes on, the blocks in <i>Tetris</i> fall faster so the game does become more exciting, but not in the sense of an
    escalating drama.</span></p>

  <p><span >If most of Polti‚Äôs 36 dramatic situations
    are used, VoD‚Ü'1 if few are used VoD‚Ü'0. To achieve VoD‚Ü'1 the
    object in question must be categorised as an embodied story, since most of
    Polti‚Äôs units require characters with particular capabilities (described
    previously). Furthermore, these characters have classical Aristotelian roles:
    major-protagonist and antagonist and minor-helper and hinderer (Aristotle
    1973). The continuity of a single story requires major characters being
    involved in the majority of the dramatic situations for most of the events.
    Thus we create another measure for the continuity of characters‚Äô involvement in
    the set of unique dramatic situations </span><i><span 
>U</span></i><span
>, using major characters <i>M</i> and minor characters </span><i><span
 >C</span></i><span
>, and we weight minor characters by an (arbitrary) factor of 5 as a
    penalty.</span></p>

>(</span><i><span  >M</span></i><span
 
>+</span><span  >5*</span><i><span  
>C)</span></i></p>
  <p><span >Thus a story with a high number of
    characters has IiD0, but IiD‚Ü'zero faster with an increase in the number
    of minor as opposed to major characters. For an unembodied story with zero
    characters, IiD=1/0 which is mathematically undeÔ¨Åned. Thus we have another case
    for questioning whether people should talk about unembodied stories (some
    computer games) in terms of stories.</span></p>

  <h3>6. Extended Application: <i>Street
    Survivor</i> </h3>
  <p><i><span >Street
    Sur</span></i><span >vivor is an independent computer game, conceived
    and produced by independent Ô¨Ålm maker Kirsty Baird and funded by Big hART Inc,
    the City of Melbourne and the Australian Film Commission. It is a third person
    action adventure game for the PC that thrusts players into the role of Sonya, a
    recently homeless teenager, who spirals into a cycle of addiction, hunger,
    violence and crime as she Ô¨Çees from her past and searches for another kind of
    future. </span></p>

  <p><span >The target audience for <i>Street Survivor</i> is young people who are
    homeless or at risk of homelessness through the installation of the game in
    frontline youth service agencies. The game does not offer easy answers but
    provides opportunities for the player to make a range of choices under
    pressure. <i>Street Survivor</i> game is
    still being developed with the intention of producing a testable prototype or
    complete small game. </span></p>
  <p><span >The following is the original design and
    story for <i>Street Survivor</i> which was
    in the early stages of its development.</span></p>
  <h3>6.1 Street Survivor Version 1 </h3>
  <p><span >Cinematic: Sonya‚Äôs back story </span></p>
  <p><span >I left home when I was 16. My mum had a new
    boyfriend and he used to hit her when he was drunk. If I tried to stop him,
    he‚Äôd lash out at me as well. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore the Ô¨Åghting... the
    noise. I knew of a guy called Paddo, an old friend of my mum‚Äôs. I thought he
    might be able to help me out. Last I heard he was in the city somewhere. So I
    hit the streets.</span></p>
  <h4>Level One: </h4>
  <p><span >Location: The streets. Objective: To Ô¨Ånd a
    friend, to learn about and explore the environment Notes: First time on the
    streets. Prototype level.</span></p>
  <p><span >This level is set on the streets at about
    6pm on a cold night. Sonya reaches the city for the Ô¨Årst time in search of an
    old family friend, Paddo. She is cold and desperate and sad but determined to
    Ô¨Ånd him. She asks around. She meets Ray and Crystal and explores the city. The
    player learns to click on objects and people and learns that this behaviour
    gives them health points or information that helps them through the level. The
    player also encounters the Dealer and learns that this character sends them into
    another world, a distorted world and that this decreases their health points
    and increases their habit points. At the end of this level, Sonya meets Paddo.
    Paddo o</span><span  
>ff</span><span >ers her
    some ‚Äúwork‚Äù.</span></p>
  <p><span >The Dealer: In this level Sonya connects
    with the Dealer and has positive experiences. She goes into a distorted world
    which gives her health and alleviates her pain. This includes loss of keyboard
    controls. Some kinds of euphoria expressed visually and in the game mechanics. </span></p>
  <p><span >Cinematic: Sonya is frightened by him and
    runs away from him into the encroaching night.</span></p>
  <h4>Level Two: </h4>
  <p><span >Location: Squat. Objective: Looking for
    somewhere to sleep the night/shelter </span></p>
  <p><span >Sonya sees Ray again and again she asks him
    for help. This time he is drunk, he doesn‚Äôt recognise her and he sends her to a
    (dangerous) squat. The squat is a huge abandoned building in the city. Once she
    is inside this squat it is like a house of horrors. It is very dark. She has to
    negotiate her way through the space which is full of long corridors, big rooms
    and stairways.</span></p>
  <p><span >There are people in the squat but they are
    unhelpful towards her they scare her off, chase her, threaten her, protecting
    their space. She has to try to get through the space by avoiding these people.
    She spends the night Ô¨Åghting back</span></p>
  <p><span >. </span></p>
  <p><span >The Dealer: In this level when Sonya
    connects with the Dealer her experiences in that other world become darker and
    more threatening. The amount of health points that these experiences give her
    decreases. She runs the risk of overdosing, if her habit is too high and her health
    level is too low. She sees things in the distorted world that scare her. She
    has to Ô¨Åght.</span></p>
  <p><span >Whilst she is in this level she encounters
    the Dealer again and again. Each time she encounters the Dealer the experiences
    she has in the distorted world get stronger and more full on. The squat morphs
    and warps and distorts and the unfriendly people in the squat pursue her and
    Ô¨Åght her.</span></p>
  <h4>Level Three: </h4>
  <p><span >Location: Back on the Streets. Objective:
    Money Notes: Downward spiral, full blown addiction, hanging out. Withdrawal. </span></p>
  <p><span >If she survives the night she is back on
    the streets. It is morning. Cold. The city is busy with people. It is chaotic
    and confusing. She is very much the worse for wear, her clothing is dirty and
    torn, she looks more haggard than before. She has had her back pack stolen and
    has no possessions left and therefore has no money. She needs to score. She
    goes in search of the Dealer but he won‚Äôt have a bar of her. He won‚Äôt help her
    out unless she can Ô¨Ånd money to score. He won‚Äôt give her any more free hits.
    She is weak, shaking and coming down. She goes to the fast food joint looking
    for someone who might help her. She Ô¨Ånds Crystal there. Crystal sends her to
    Tan. Tan gives her a parcel for Paddo. Once she has the parcel she is under
    threat from new enemies. These are enemies that exist in the real world of the
    city thugs who are rivals of Paddo‚Äôs. If she survives their attack she has no
    choice but to do the work that he o</span><span  
>ff</span><span
>ered her in level one.</span></p>
  <p><span >The Dealer: She is withdrawing. She
    desperately wants to connect with the Dealer. She pursues him but she is weak
    and he is indi</span><span  
>ff</span><span >erent to her
    e.g. Habit meter is at dangerous level if it is too low or too high.</span></p>
  <h4>Level Four: </h4>
  <p><span >Objective: To survive the car chase.
    Location: Car on city streets. Notes: Car chase. Crime. </span></p>
  <p><span >Suddenly she is driving a car through the
    city streets and the game play is now Ô¨Årst person. A voice is yelling at her
    from the back seat. It is Tan. In the passenger seat a person is inert and bleeding.
    Tan is telling her to turn down certain streets and to keep driving. It is a
    frantic situation. If she crashes the car she dies. But she doesn‚Äôt have to do
    what Tan says. If she doesn‚Äôt take the turns he suggests she can Ô¨Ånish the
    level without dying. The car eventually crashes into a dead end and a cinematic
    occurs. You always crash. The choice here is between dying and injury. </span></p>
  <p><span >Extended cinematic: Car crash, injury,
    arrest. Hospital. Court system.</span></p>
  <h4>Level Five: </h4>
  <p><span >Location: Jail Objective: To detox. Notes:
    Realisation. Dream sequence. Doing time. Going through the motions. </span></p>
  <p><span >Sonya is lying on a bed in a prison cell.
    She is asleep. She is dreaming. In her dream she is back on the streets of the
    distorted city she accesses through her interactions with the Dealer. A rapid
    and intense Ô¨Åght sequence takes place. During this Ô¨Åght sequence she recognises
    a distorted version of herself. She Ô¨Åghts herself and wins. Requiem for a Dream
    visual sequence ie: di</span><span  
>ff</span><span >erent
    camera. You can‚Äôt actually lose this level.</span></p>
  <p><span >The Dealer: She ‚Äùseeks‚Äù him out. She
    realises that he embodies her resistance to change. </span></p>
  <p><span >End cinematic: </span></p>
  <p><span >Something about home. Finding a home.
    Meeting a friend. Very short.</span></p>
  <h3>6.2 Evaluation of <i>Street Survivor</i> Story Draft 1</h3>
  <p><span >We now follow our own process for story
    evaluation on this original story design for <i>Street Survivor</i>. </span></p>
  <p><span >1. Identify as many Polti units as possible </span><i><span  >P</span></i><span >. </span></p>
  <p><span >We try to identify all Polti‚Äôs units level
    by level. In Level 1 Sonya plays out </span><u><span 
>th</span><span
>e </span></u><u><span  
>enigm</span><span >a</span></u><span
> searching for Paddo, after </span><u><span 
>fallin</span><span
>g </span></u><u><span  
>pre</span><span >y </span></u><u><span
 >t</span><span
>o </span></u><u><span  
>misfortune</span></u><span >. She </span><u><span
 >obtain</span><span
>s</span></u><span > experiences from the Dealer and work
    from Paddo. So P</span><i><span  
>L</span></i><span 
>1</span><span
>=3. In Level 2 Sonya switches targets to <u>searching</u> for
    somewhere to sleep. Her negotiation through the squat is a </span><u><span
 >darin</span><span
>g </span></u><u><span  
>enterprise</span></u><span >, and
    she continues to </span><u><span  
>obtai</span><span >n</span></u><span
> experiences from the Dealer. Thus P</span><i><span 
>L</span></i><span
 >2</span><span >=3. In Level 3 Sonya switches <u>search</u> target to the Dealer. She </span><u><span  
>obtain</span><span >s</span></u><span
> from Tan, but this creates fresh enemies </span><u><span
 >fallin</span><span
>g </span></u><u><span  
>pre</span><span >y </span></u><u><span
 >t</span><span
>o </span></u><u><span  
>misfortune</span></u><span >. Thus P</span><i><span
 >L</span></i><span  
>3</span><span >=3. Level 4
    contains </span><u><span  >crim</span><span >e </span></u><u><span 
>pursue</span><span
>d </span></u><u><span  
>b</span><span >y </span></u><u><span
 >vengeanc</span><span
>e</span></u><span > and branches to </span><u><span
 >fata</span><span
>l </span></u><u><span  
>impudenc</span><span >e</span></u><span
> so P</span><i><span  
>L</span></i><span 
>4</span><span
>=2. In Level 5 Sonya Ô¨Åghts herself </span><u><span 
>enmit</span><span
>y </span></u><u><span  
>o</span><span >f </span></u><u><span
 >kinsma</span><span
>n</span></u><span > and <u>seeks</u> the Dealer. Thus P</span><i><span
 >L</span></i><span  
>5</span><span >=2. In the
    denouement Sonya Ô¨Ånds a home and a friend, tying up the </span><u><span
 >fallin</span><span
>g </span></u><u><span  
>pre</span><span >y </span></u><u><span
 >t</span><span
>o </span></u><u><span  
>misfortun</span><span >e</span></u><span
> in Level 1. The summation is <i>P</i>=13.</span></p>
  <p><span >2. Identify (roughly) the number of events </span><i><span
 >E</span></i><span
>. </span></p>
  <p><span >We manually counted the events level by
    level. Note that we‚Äôre not aiming for precise accuracy, just a rough estimate.
    E</span><i><span  
>L</span></i><span  
>1 = </span><span >6, E</span><i><span 
>L</span></i><span
 >2 = </span><span >10, E</span><i><span
 >L</span></i><span  >3 = </span><span
>7, E</span><i><span  
>L</span></i><span 
>4 </span><span >=6 and E</span><i><span
 >L</span></i><span  >5 = </span><span
>3. Adding all these up gives E=32.</span></p>
  <p><span 
>3. </span>From P, identify the unique units U. <br>
    Looking back through our list of P we identify unique units (the enigma,
    falling prey to misfortune, obtaining, daring enterprise, crime pursued by
    vengeance,fatal impudence, and enmity of kinsman). Thus U =7.</p>
  <p>4. Count and categorise the characters as major M or minor C. <br>
    The original story has a single main character Sonya (M=1) and Ô¨Åve minor
    characters Paddo, Ray, Crystal, Dealer and Tan (C=5). Despite the Dealer‚Äôs
    frequent contact with Sonya, it was a game constraint that the Dealer was not
    to be demonised as an antagonist, although Sonya‚Äôs relation to the Dealer is
    certainly ambiguous. </p>
  <p><span >5. Plug all these numbers into the Polti
    ratios. </span></p>
  <p><i><span  
>Leve</span></i><span >l </span><i><span
 >o</span></i><span
>f </span><i><span  
>Drama</span></i><span >(</span><i><span
 >LoD</span></i><span
>)= </span><i><span  
>P/</span></i><span >E = 13</span><i><span
 >/</span></i><span
>32 ‚âà<sub><span > </span></sub>0</span><i><span
 >.</span></i><span
>4 </span></p>
  <p><span >V</span><i><span 
>ariet</span></i><span
>y </span><i><span  
>o</span></i><span >f </span><i><span
 >Drama</span></i><span
>(V </span><i><span  
>oD</span></i><span >)= </span><i><span
 >U/</span></i><span
>36 = 7</span><i><span  
>/</span></i><span >36‚âà<sub><span
> </span></sub>0</span><i><span 
>.</span></i><span
>2 </span></p>
  <p><i><span >Involvemen</span></i><span >t <i>in</i> <i>Drama</i>(<i>IiD</i>)= <i>U/</i>(M+5*<i>C</i>)=7<i>/</i>(1+5*<sub><span
> </span></sub>5)=7<i>/</i>26 ‚âà<sub><span
> </span></sub>0<i>.</i>27 </span></p>
  <p><span >Thus we ended up with total scores of
    LoD‚âà0.4, VoD‚âà0.2 and IiD‚âà0.27. So how do these numbers compare with the
    Polti-ideal story (where LoD‚Ü'‚àû, VoD=1 and IiD=18)? Firstly, the number of
    events counted (32) is contestable, given the scope the player of Sonya is
    allowed to explore, particularly in Level 1. Thus the level of drama might be
    much worse than 0.4. Secondly, the VoD is not so close to 1 that (in our
    opinion) it appears likely to be highly difficult to introduce new Polti units
    into the story. Also the IiD seems not so high that it will be difficult to
    improve.</span></p>
  <h3>6.3 Improving the Story Abstraction </h3>
  <p><span >We now follow our approach to reconceiving
    a story abstraction, to try to improve the ‚Äùdramaticality‚Äù towards the
    Polti-ideal story essentially by increasing P and U and decreasing </span><i><span
 >E</span></i><span
>,M and C : </span></p>
  <p><span >1. Eliminate irrelevant Polti‚Äôs units with
    respect to the story. </span></p>
  <p><span >There appear (from our point of view) to be
    eighteen dramatic situations which have little relevance to this story without
    signiÔ¨Åcant modiÔ¨Åcations: </span><u><span

    reconceived abstract story we have IiD‚âà2.29, LoD‚âà0.55 and VoD‚âà0.44. All of
    these ratios are higher in the second version, closer to the Polti-ideal. A
    story based on these with this event budget should be more dramatic. We made a
    trade-off between VoD and IiD to introduce more dramatic situations we
    proposed a new character, the Step Father, but we were able to compensate for
    that by eliminating several peripheral minor characters.</span></p>
  <p><span >After discussions, Baird worked to realise
    these dramatic situations within the actual story. The following is a later
    (but not the latest) version of <i>Street
    Survivor</i> which incorporates much of the above.</span></p>
  <h3>6.4 <i>Street Survivor</i> Version 2 </h3>
  <p><i><span >Street
    Survivor</span></i><span > revolves around the story of a young girl
    Sonya who has left a home disrupted by the violence of her Step Father. Sonya
    goes into the city in search of her sister, Amy, who has left home before her

  <p><span >By level 4 of the game Sonya, who is back
    on the streets of the city, has developed an addiction to Quick that is now
    controlling her. She is dominated by her need to buy Quick from the Dealer to
    escape from her Step Father but also to service the addiction she has
    established. She needs money to buy the Quick so she turns to crime, begging,
    mugging people and bag snatching. Her bad behaviour sees her develop more
    enemies and she becomes more and more vulnerable to withdrawal and overdose
    whilst still getting hungry, cold, and tired. She also needs to use clean
    water, syringe bins and must continue to ask around for Amy. She can go back to
    the Squat once in this level. In this level of the game Sonya develops her
    Ô¨Åghting skills as she spirals downwards into heavier addiction and worse
    behaviour. If she gets captured by her Step Father in this level she goes back
    home and then to the Train Station as before. If she collapses she gets rescued
    by a stranger who takes her to a safe place and then back to the Train Station.</span></p>
  <p><span >Eventually Sonya takes on a task for the
    Dealer. She crosses town to deliver a parcel for him. In return she gets given
    a hit of Quick, she overdoses and this takes her into level 5, the last level
    of the game. Level 5 is set in a dream like hospital. Sonya meets and Ô¨Åghts a
    version of herself. This version of herself is her nemesis, her alter ego once
    she gives up (stops fighting) and gets beaten the game ends.</span></p>
  <h3>7. Conclusion </h3>
  <p><span >In this paper we made three contributions.
    First, we created a theory of stories which distinguishes between games and
    stories at several levels of game abstraction, based primarily on the existence
    of characters, whose capabilities are derived from Polti‚Äôs thirty-six dramatic
    situations. Games that lack characters require considerable stretching to
    metamorphose into Polti‚Äôs units, thus their analysis in terms of stories is
    contestable. Second, we developed measures of the ‚Äùdramaticality‚Äù of stories
    called Polti ratios and proposed a Polti-ideal story to which all abstractions
    could be compared.</span></p>

  <p><span  >While
    Version 2 of <i>Street Survivor</i> did
    appear to be more highly dramatic than Version 1, the ways in which a player
    would interact with the game remained largely constant. The reason for this was
    sheer momentum the game prototype was being developed while the game treatment
    was being developed whatever narrative we produced had to be able to be
    implemented atop working code due to tight budgets. In this case, game
    narrative could be considered independently of game playability because the game
    already implemented characters and we minimally modified these.</span></p>

 >The Thirty-Six Dramatic
    Situations</span></a></h3>
  <p><span >From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
    (4/9/2007)</span></p>
  <p><i><span >The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations</span></i><span
> is a descriptive list which was created by Georges Polti to categorize
    every dramatic situation that might occur in a story or performance. To do this
    Polti analyzed classical Greek texts, plus classical and contemporaneous French
    works. He also analyzed a handful of non-French authors. In his introduction,
    Polti claims to be continuing the work of Carlo Gozzi, who also identified 36
    situations.</span></p>
  <p><span >This list was published in a book of the same
    name, which contains extended explanations and examples. The original
    French-language book was written in the 19th century. An English translation
    was published in 1917 and continues to be reprinted to this day.</span></p>
  <p><span >The list is popularized as an aid for writers,
    but it is also used by dramatists, storytellers and many others. Other similar
    lists have since been made, some more attuned to modern sensibilities, but
    Poltis guide remains one of the most popular and enduring.</span></p>
